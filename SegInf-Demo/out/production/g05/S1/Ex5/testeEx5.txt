Hash functions are extremely useful and appear in almost all information security applications.

A hash function is a mathematical function that converts a numerical input value into another compressed numerical value. The input to the hash function is of arbitrary length but output is always of fixed length.

Values returned by a hash function are called message digest or simply hash values. The following picture illustrated hash function.

Java provides a class named MessageDigest which belongs to the package java.security. This class supports algorithms such as SHA-1, SHA 256, MD5 algorithms to convert an arbitrary length message to a message digest.

To convert a given message to a message digest, follow the steps given below âˆ’

Step 1: Create a MessageDigest object
The MessageDigest class provides a method named getInstance(). This method accepts a String variable specifying the name of the algorithm to be used and returns a MessageDigest object implementing the specified algorithm.

Create MessageDigest object using the getInstance() method as shown below.

MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
Step 2: Pass data to the created MessageDigest object
After creating the message digest object, you need to pass the message/data to it. You can do so using the update() method of the MessageDigest class, this method accepts a byte array representing the message and adds/passes it to the above created MessageDigest object.
